## Infrastructure Service (Sloky Service)

### Overview

Sometimes, starting a service 24/7 when your traffic is not necessary. The traffic is low, and your customer is patient -> we can cut the cost by using an **on demand service**. Which means,
we'll start the service whenever there is an user.

**Sloky** is a Infrastructure as Code platform, built on top of Pulumi.
